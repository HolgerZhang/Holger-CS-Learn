It was on a cold winter morning long ago, that Robin Gore, a bold hunter of the backwoods of America, entered his parlour and sat him down to breakfast.

Robin¡¯s parlour was also his dining-room, and his drawing-room, besides being his bedroom and his kitchen. In fact, it was the only room in his wooden hut, except a small apartment, opening off it, which was a workshop and lumber-room.

Robin¡¯s family consisted of himself, and his wife, and his son Roy, who was twelve years of ageand his daughter Nelly, who was eight, or thereabout. In addition to these, his household comprised a nephew, Walter and an Irishman, Larry O¡¯Dowd. The former was tall, strong, fearless, and twenty. The latter was stout, short, powerful, and forty.
